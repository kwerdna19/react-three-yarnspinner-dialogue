Ideas

- memoize Dialog.tsx - with shallow comparison of options, etc.

- Add bouncing arrow indicator for when has next dialog to go to

- Figure out associating image/s with character
- Figure out image display, prominence while talking, etc
- Background image/s for scene

- preset list of "commands" for interacting with the THREE scene - config objects with names for recognizing commands 
- yarn verification step, verify all called function exist, custom commands make sense (using above)
